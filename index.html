                <p class="italic">Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</p><br>
                <p>Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be
                    better than gasoline-powered cars. With instant torque, incredible power, and zero emissions, Tesla’s products would be cars
                    without compromise. Each new generation would be increasingly affordable, helping the company work towards its mission:
                    to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport.</p><br>
                <p>Tesla’s engineers first designed a powertrain for a sports car built around an AC induction motor, patented in 1888 by Nikola Tesla,
                    the inventor who inspired the company’s name. The resulting Tesla Roadster was launched in 2008. Accelerating from 0 to 60 mph
                    in 3.7 seconds and achieving a range of 245 miles per charge of its lithium ion battery, the Roadster set a new standard
                    for electric mobility. Tesla would sell more than 2,400 Roadsters, now on the road in more than 30 countries.</p><br>

                <p class="italic">We believe that incumbent automobile manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry-wide challenges.</p><br>
                <p>The reliance on the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine as the principal automobile powertrain technology has
                    raised environmental concerns, created dependence among industrialized and developing nations on oil largely imported
                    from foreign nations and exposed consumers to volatile fuel prices. In addition, we believe the legacy investments made by
                    incumbent automobile manufacturers in manufacturing and technology related to the internal combustion engine have to date
                    inhibited rapid innovation in alternative fuel powertrain technologies. </p><br>
                <p>We believe these challenges offer a historic opportunity for companies with innovative electric powertrain technologies and that
                    are unencumbered with legacy investments in the internal combustion engine to lead the next technological era of the automotive
                    industry.</p><br>
